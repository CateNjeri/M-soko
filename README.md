Ka-Wi is an ecommerce website made in Ember. It is for a business (Ka-Wi) that delivers coffee to the customers' doors. This site allows users to view each product, and add it to their cart (using a service in ember), and calculates the total. Users can then 'checkout' (simply empties the cart, resets the total, and displays a message). The website also allows users to read product descriptions, leave a review, and read reviews left by previous customers. The review display is sorted from most recent to least recent (using a computed property).
